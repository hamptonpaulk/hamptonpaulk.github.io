  		<p>As each of us were growing up, and some of us still are, all we wanted to do is
make. It did not matter if we were making a robot, a cake, or just a big mess,
we just have this deep need to make something.</p>
<p>I still want to make and to create, no matter the outcome, it satisfies my soul.
There are days that I go in to the shop to do nothing more than make sawdust or
to make an LED blink. I don't have to walk away with anything physical to walk
away with something tangible. This is meditation.</p>
<p>I continue this desire to make on a regular basis, always working on some random
project, mostly because I was raised to be this way.
I was raised with mother's leadership example and her desire to show us, my
brother and I, how to <strong>make meaningful relationships</strong>.</p>
<p>I was raised by fathers love for the outdoors and showing me that <strong>you have to
put in work to have a worthwhile harvest</strong>.</p>
<p>I was raised by my grandfather's passion for <strong>hard meaningful work</strong>, his
mastery of woodworking and mechanics. He was <strong>never afraid to take anything
apart</strong> and would go above and beyond to bring a machine back to life when
others would just throw it away.</p>
<p>I was raised by my grandmother's patient and loving hands, showing us <strong>the ways
of the garden, the kitchen, and the happy home</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a reasonably traditional form of education, one that so many parents
are un-able to provide for their children as we move to a society of thought
workers. I know we can bring this back by taking the time to immerse the young
and teach the teachers. The question is where I start, where can we start?</p>
